TrajectoryPlannerROS:

# Robot Configuration Parameters
  acc_lim_x: 1.0 #(double, default: 2.5) The x acceleration limit of the robot in meters/sec^2
  acc_lim_y: 0.0 #(double, default: 2.5) The y acceleration limit of the robot in meters/sec^2
  acc_lim_theta: 0.6 #(double, default: 3.2) The rotational acceleration limit of the robot in radians/sec^2

  max_vel_x: 0.25 #(double, default: 0.5) The maximum velocity allowed for the base in meters/sec
  min_vel_x: 0.00 #(double, default: 0.1) The minimum forward velocity allowed for the base in meters/sec. It is useful to specify this to guarantee that velocity commands sent to a mobile base are high enough to allow the base to overcome friction.

  max_vel_theta: 1.0 #(double, default: 1.0) The maximum rotational velocity allowed for the base in radians/sec
  min_vel_theta: -1.0 #(double, default: -1.0) The minimum rotational velocity allowed for the base in radians/sec
  min_in_place_vel: 0.4 #(double, default: 0.4) The minimum rotational velocity allowed for the base while performing in-place rotations in radian/sec

  escape_vel: -0.1 #(double, default: -0.1) Speed used for backing up during escapes in meters/sec. Note that it must be negative in order for the robot to actually reverse

# Differential-drve Robot Configuration
  holonomic_robot: false #(bool, default: true)

# Goal Tolerance Parameters
  yaw_goal_tolerance: 0.05 #(double, default: 0.05) The tolerance in radians for the controller in yaw/rotation when achieving its goal
  xy_goal_tolerance: 0.10 #(double, default: 0.10) The tolerance in meters for the controller in the x & y distance when achieving a goal
  latch_xy_goal_tolerance: true #(bool, default: false) If the goal is latched, if the robot ever reaches the goal xy location it will simply rotate in place, even if it ends up outside teh goal tolerance while it doing so.

# Forward Simulation Parameters
  sim_time: 3.0 #(double, default: 1.0) The amount of time to forward-simulate trajectories in seconds
  sim_granularity: 0.05 #(double, default: 0.025) The step size, in meters, to take between points on a given trajectory
  angular_sim_granularity: 0.05 #(double, default: ~<name/sim_granularity) The step size, in radians, to take between angular samples on a given trajectory
  vx_samples: 18 #(integer, default: 3) The number of samples to use when exploring the x velocity space
  vtheta_samples: 20 #(integer, default: 20) The number of samples to use when exploring the theta velocity space
  controller_frequency: 20 #(double, default: 20.0) The frequency at which this controller will be called in Hz. Uses searchParam to read the parameter from parent namespaces if not set in the namespace of the controller. For use with move_base, this means that you only need to set its "controller_frequency" parameter and can safely leave this one unset.

# Trajectory Scoring Parameters
  meter_scoring: false #(bool, default: false) Whether the gdist_scale and pdist_scale parameters should assume the goal_distance and path_distance are expressed in units of meters or cells. Cells are assumed by default
  pdist_scale: 5.0 #(double, default: 0.6) The weighting for how much the controller should stay close to the path it was given, maximal possible value is 5.0
  gdist_scale: 5.0 #(double, default: 0.8) The weighting for how much the controller should attempt to reach its local goal, also controls speed, maximal possible value is 5.0
  occdist_scale: 1.0 #(double, default: 0.01) The weighting for how much the controller should attempt to avoid obstacles
  heading_lookahead: 0.325 #(double, default: 0.325) How far to look ahead in meters when scoring different in-place-rotation trajectories
  heading_scoring: false #(bool, default: false) Whether to score based on the robot's heading to the path or its distance from the path
  heading_scoring_timestep: 0.8 #(double, default: 0.8) How far to look ahead in time in seconds along the simulated trajectory when using heading scoring
  dwa: false #(bool, default: true) Whether to use Dynamic Window Approach (DWA) or whether to use Trajectory Rollout (NOTE: DWA worked as well as Trajectory Rollout and is computationally less expensive)
  publish_cost_grid_pc: false #(bool, default: false) Whether or not to publish the cost grid that the planner will use when planning. When true, a sensor_msgs/PointCloud2 il be available on the ~<name>/costcloud topic. 
  global_frame_id: odom #(string, default: odom) The frame to set the cost_cloud. Should set to the same frame as the local costmap's global frame

# Oscillation Prevention Parameters
  oscillation_reset_dist: 0.05 #(double, default: 0.05) How far the robot must travel in meters before oscillation flags are reset

# Global Plan Parameters
  prune_plan: true #(bool, default: true) Defines whether or not to eat up the plan as the robot moves along the path. If set to true. points will fall off the end of the plan once teh robot moves 1 meter past them
